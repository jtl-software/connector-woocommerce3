processes and deal with complex tax issues.

Many sellers also use JTL-Connector to transfer their data to JTL-Wawi and test our
proprietary online shop system [JTL-Shop](https://www.jtl-software.de/online-shopsystem).


== STARTING EASY WITH STANDARD VERSIONS ==

Sellers often use standard shop systems without personalised features, plug-ins and added functions.
Out-of-the-box shops like these can be connected to JTL-Wawi with a few simple steps using JTL-Connector.


== CONNECTING INDIVIDUAL PLUG-INS ==

You have made individual adjustments to your shop, e.g. the installation of plug-ins? In this case,
JTL-Connector needs an individual configuration for each of the plug-ins. To facilitate this, JTL-Connector
features an integrated [plug-in interface](https://www.jtl-software.de/anbindung-shopsysteme#plugin-system-fuer-individualisierte-onlineshops),
enabling the transfer of personalised data and functions to JTL-Wawi.


== HOW IT WORKS ==

* Initial data synchronisation

In the course of the initial synchronisation, data such as items, categories, images and customer and
order information is transferred from your shop to JTL-Wawi. If you want to use JTL-Wawi as the leading
system, you can directly and exclusively manage your products and process your online shop orders in
JTL-Wawi right after the initial synchronisation.

* Individual data maintenance

Many of the performance features that JTL-Wawi offers can also be used in your online shop via the
JTL-Connector, provided your shop system also offers these functionalities. Some functionalities of
your online shops are not transferred by JTL-Connector by default. Those can be added individually via
plug-ins or additional programming.

* Continuous synchronisation

The data created or changed by you in JTL-Wawi is transferred to your shop via the
online shop synchronisation. Orders placed in your shop are directly forwarded to JTL-Wawi.
You can process all orders, including shipping and returns, in JTL-Wawi. The current order
status is transferred to your shop via JTL-Connector. In this way, your customers are always
informed about the status of their orders.

* Combined operation

You can also operate JTL-Connector and your shop in a combined mode. In this case, you define what
data is to be imported into JTL-Wawi or transferred to your online shop. You can specify, for example,
that JTL-Wawi only updates stocks for the shop and only imports orders. This means that you still maintain
your products in the back end of your online shop.


== FUTURE-PROOF DEVELOPMENT ==

JTL-Software holds all the knowledge to ensure the future-proof development of the JTL connectors.
This know-how enables us to react quickly to changing requirements and to adapt JTL-Connector to
evolving connected shop systems. This ensures trouble-free compatibility with future versions.
